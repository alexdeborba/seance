== Description ==

Séance was created to provide a solid monochromatic foundation embraced with an aura of dichromacy, and trichromacy, therefore, favouring those with colour vision deficiency within darker and lighter palettes yet poetically oriented with gothic aesthetics aimed at avid, inspiring writers for its clarity and minimalist approach.

Remarkably lightweight, assertive, featuring colour palettes drawn to accessibility, and full-featured with dozens of carefully handcrafted Gutenberg Block Patterns that gently bring the strength of minimalistic visuals to content as if flipping pages of a book quickly with gentle fingertips while reading words with leisure.

Fully customizable, Séance embraces the Full Site Editing features introduced in WordPress 5.9 and, in its unusual manner, accommodates a new writing and visual experience.
