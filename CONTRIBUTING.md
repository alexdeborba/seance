# Contributing

I genuinely appreciate you are considering contributing to Séance, be it for the [Block Editor](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/themes/block-theme-overview/), [Gutenberg Block Patterns](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/themes/block-theme-overview/), [Global Styles](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/themes/theme-json/), [Code](https://github.com/alexdeborba/seance), or Beta Testing. Your contribution is always more than welcome.

Nonetheless, I do have some requirements, which are:

- No self-promotion.
- Code that passes the [WordPress Standards](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/).

Even if you are unsure of anything, you are more than welcome to open an [issue](https://github.com/alexdeborba/seance/issues) or a [pull request](https://github.com/alexdeborba/seance/pulls) on any topic to get further guidance.

The worst that can happen is that you will be politely directed to the best location to ask your question or to change something in your [pull request](https://github.com/alexdeborba/seance/pulls).

I appreciate any contribution and do not want to impose a ruling that may obstruct contributions.

However, I wish to ensure a welcoming environment for everyone to get involved. This said all contributors are expected to follow the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/alexdeborba/seance/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
