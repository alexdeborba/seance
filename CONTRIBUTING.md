# Contributing

Contributions to open source projects like Séance can significantly improve the project, help others in the community, and even improve your own skills. As with any open source project, there are various ways you can contribute:


## Code Contributions

This could involve bug fixes, new features, or other code changes. Be sure to familiarize yourself with the project's codebase and guidelines before starting. And always remember, no contribution is too small. Even minor bug fixes can have a huge impact on the project.


## Block Editor and Gutenberg Block Patterns

If you have experience with the WordPress [Block Editor](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/themes/block-theme-overview/) and [Gutenberg Block Patterns](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/themes/block-theme-overview/), your contribution could be invaluable. Creating or improving block patterns can help users easily design and build their sites.


## Global Styles

Help with defining and improving the [Global Styles](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/themes/theme-json/) in the theme. This could include everything from colors, typography, and other design elements.


## Beta Testing

If you are not comfortable contributing code, beta testing is a great way to contribute. Test new features, try to break things, and report any bugs you find. Your feedback can help improve the project's stability and usability.


## Documentation

Documentation is as important as the code itself. You could contribute by writing, updating, or even just proofreading documentation.


## Translations

If you are multilingual, consider contributing by translating the theme or its documentation.


## Donations

If you cannot contribute in these ways, consider donating to support the project.


## Requirements

Nonetheless, I do have some requirements, which are:

- No self-promotion.
- Code that passes the [WordPress Standards](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/).

Even if you are unsure of anything, you are more than welcome to open an [issue](https://github.com/alexdeborba/seance/issues) or a [pull request](https://github.com/alexdeborba/seance/pulls) on any topic to get further guidance.

The worst that can happen is that you will be politely directed to the best location to ask your question or to change something in your [pull request](https://github.com/alexdeborba/seance/pulls).

I appreciate any contribution and do not want to impose a ruling that may obstruct contributions.

However, I wish to ensure a welcoming environment for everyone to get involved. This said all contributors are expected to follow the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/alexdeborba/seance/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
